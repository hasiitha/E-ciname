The Lion King is a 2019 American musical film directed and produced by Jon Favreau, written by Jeff Nathanson, and produced by Walt Disney Pictures.
 It is a photorealistic computer-animated remake of Disney's traditionally animated 1994 film of the same name.
 The film stars the voices of Donald Glover, Seth Rogen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Alfre Woodard, Billy Eichner, John Kani, John Oliver, and Beyonc√© Knowles-Carter, 
 as well as James Earl Jones reprising his role from the original film. The plot follows Simba, 
 a young lion who must embrace his role as the rightful king of his native land following the murder of his father, Mufasa, at the hands of his uncle, Scar.

Plans for a remake of The Lion King were confirmed in September 2016 following the success of Disney's The Jungle Book, also directed by Favreau.
Much of the main cast signed in early 2017, and principal production began in mid-2017 on a blue screen stage in Los Angeles. With an estimated budget of around $260 million,
it is one of the most expensive films ever made.

The film was theatrically released in the United States on July 19, 2019. 
It has grossed $1.5 billion worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing animated film (overtaking Frozen), as well as the second highest-grossing film of 2019
and ninth-highest-grossing film of all time. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its visual effects, music, and 
vocal performances (particularly Rogen and Eichner) but criticism for its lack of facial emotion on the characters, and being described as "soulless" compared to the original film.
